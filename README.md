# TutorialScroll
A fixed scrolling device tutorial section for ReactJS like that of uber.com

Basically a web page section with 3 child sections of content and a device on the left whose screen will change ass the user scrolls down. The neat thing about this design is that there is no scroll-hacking going on so it feels much nicer on the user's side.
